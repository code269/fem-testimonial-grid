Questions & Considerations:
- Design specifies 500/600 font weight, causing slight differences to design.
- Colors hard to eyeball, especially last card with Kira's title, should be lighter shade than the other white background card.

To-Do:

- Tablet
    - Add max-width at tablet size
    - [?] Should I start using grid at tablet size?

- Desktop
    - Grid display
    - Quotation mark image using position (likely)

- Refractor
    - Am I overusing/underusing classes?
    - Can I combine some classes?
    - Are there classes that I'm not using?
